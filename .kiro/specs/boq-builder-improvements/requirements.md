# BOQ Builder Critical Improvements - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines critical improvements to the BOQ Builder application to enhance performance, reliability, user experience, and maintainability. The improvements focus on addressing architectural issues, adding proper error handling, optimizing database performance, and implementing modern state management patterns.

The current application suffers from performance bottlenecks, lacks proper error boundaries, has complex state management spread across multiple components, and provides limited user feedback during operations. These improvements will transform the application into a more robust, performant, and user-friendly tool.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Application Stability and Error Handling

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to handle errors gracefully without crashing, so that I don't lose my work and can continue using the application even when something goes wrong.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an unexpected error occurs in any React component THEN the application SHALL display a user-friendly error boundary screen instead of a blank white page
2. WHEN an error boundary is triggered THEN the system SHALL log the error details for debugging purposes in development mode
3. WHEN a user encounters an error boundary THEN they SHALL have options to retry the operation or return to the home screen
4. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages to the user via toast notifications
5. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback about what went wrong and suggest next steps
6. WHEN form validation fails THEN the system SHALL highlight invalid fields and display specific error messages
7. WHEN the application recovers from an error THEN the user's current work SHALL be preserved where possible

### Requirement 2: User Feedback and Loading States

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see clear feedback when the application is processing my requests, so that I know the system is working and understand what's happening.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any data loading operation begins THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate loading indicator
2. WHEN database initialization occurs THEN the system SHALL show a loading screen with progress information
3. WHEN API requests are in progress THEN the system SHALL disable relevant buttons and show loading states
4. WHEN operations complete successfully THEN the system SHALL display success notifications via toast messages
5. WHEN operations fail THEN the system SHALL display error notifications with actionable information
6. WHEN long-running operations occur THEN the system SHALL provide progress indicators or estimated completion times
7. WHEN users perform actions THEN they SHALL receive immediate visual feedback confirming the action was registered

### Requirement 3: Performance Optimization and Database Efficiency

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to load quickly and respond immediately to my interactions, so that I can work efficiently without waiting for slow operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads initially THEN it SHALL complete loading within 3 seconds on standard hardware
2. WHEN database queries execute THEN they SHALL complete within 100ms for standard operations
3. WHEN large item lists are displayed THEN the system SHALL use virtualization to maintain smooth scrolling
4. WHEN searching through items THEN results SHALL appear within 200ms of typing
5. WHEN the database is queried THEN proper indexes SHALL be used to optimize performance
6. WHEN components re-render THEN unnecessary re-renders SHALL be prevented through memoization
7. WHEN the application bundle loads THEN it SHALL be under 500KB gzipped
8. WHEN memory usage is monitored THEN the application SHALL use less than 100MB of RAM during normal operation

### Requirement 4: Modern State Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want centralized and predictable state management, so that the application is easier to maintain, debug, and extend with new features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN application state changes THEN all updates SHALL go through a centralized store
2. WHEN components need shared state THEN they SHALL access it through the centralized store rather than prop drilling
3. WHEN state updates occur THEN they SHALL be immutable and predictable
4. WHEN debugging state issues THEN developers SHALL have access to state inspection tools
5. WHEN the application loads THEN critical state SHALL be persisted and restored from localStorage
6. WHEN multiple components need the same data THEN they SHALL share it through the store without duplication
7. WHEN state becomes complex THEN it SHALL be organized into logical modules (UI, data, loading, errors)
8. WHEN actions are dispatched THEN they SHALL have clear, descriptive names and consistent patterns

### Requirement 5: Input Validation and Data Integrity

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to validate my input and prevent invalid data entry, so that I can avoid mistakes and maintain data quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users enter data in forms THEN the system SHALL validate input in real-time
2. WHEN required fields are empty THEN the system SHALL prevent form submission and highlight missing fields
3. WHEN numeric fields receive non-numeric input THEN the system SHALL display validation errors
4. WHEN text fields exceed maximum length THEN the system SHALL prevent additional input and show character counts
5. WHEN users submit forms THEN all validation rules SHALL be checked before processing
6. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL focus on the first invalid field and display clear error messages
7. WHEN data is saved to the database THEN it SHALL be sanitized to prevent security issues
8. WHEN users correct validation errors THEN error messages SHALL clear immediately upon valid input

### Requirement 6: Enhanced Search and Filtering

**User Story:** As a user, I want powerful search and filtering capabilities, so that I can quickly find the items I need from large databases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users type in the search box THEN results SHALL update in real-time with debounced input
2. WHEN searching items THEN the system SHALL search across name, description, manufacturer, and part number fields
3. WHEN users apply category filters THEN only items from selected categories SHALL be displayed
4. WHEN users apply price range filters THEN only items within the specified range SHALL be shown
5. WHEN search results are displayed THEN matching text SHALL be highlighted for easy identification
6. WHEN users clear search filters THEN all items SHALL be displayed again
7. WHEN no search results are found THEN the system SHALL display a helpful "no results" message with suggestions
8. WHEN users have active filters THEN the system SHALL show filter indicators and allow easy clearing

### Requirement 7: Bulk Operations Support

**User Story:** As a user, I want to perform operations on multiple items at once, so that I can work more efficiently with large datasets.
